# Adding Identity Pool to the User Pool

Amazon Cognito identity pools (federated identities) enable you to create unique identities for your users and federate them with identity providers. With an identity pool, you can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services. Your identity pool can include:

- Users in an Amazon Cognito user pool

- Users who authenticate with external identity providers such as Facebook, Google, Apple, or a SAML-based identity provider

- Users authenticated via your own existing authentication process

With an identity pool, you can obtain temporary AWS credentials with permissions you define to directly access other AWS services or to access resources through Amazon API Gateway.
